  description: "I am a postdoctoral research associate working on the development of cutting-edge statistical methods for RNA-seq data.
  In particular, I am currently focusing on a Bayesian hierarchical model to detect genes showing differential transcript usage (DTU);  
  the method accounts for the subject-to-subject variability in the transcripts proportions and for the uncertainty in the allocation 
  of each fragment to the corresponding transcript, which is treated as a latent variable.
  In general terms, my interests are quite broad and lie in  the development of statistical methods for applications in the medical and biological fields."

  description: "In collaboration with the [Bodenmiller lab]('http://www.bodenmillerlab.com'), I have worked on correcting for spillover in CyTOF data.
  The preprint to this project is available on [bioRxiv]('https://doi.org/10.1101/185744') and is awaiting publication. 
  Alongside our compensation approach, I have made Finck et al.'s [bead-based normalization]('https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.22271') 
  and Zunder et al.'s [single-cell deconvolution]('https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2015.020') available in

  a [Bioconductor]('https://bioconductor.org') package providing tools for preprocessing and analysis of cytometry data.
  Currently, I am working on integrating M. Nowicka's [CyTOF workflow]('https://f1000research.com/articles/6-748/v1') for differential analysis into CATALYST.
  My Masters thesis project is predicated on the benchmarking of (non-)branching trajectory inference tools for scRNA-seq and cytometry data."

  As there is just few documentation about the data, one of the focus of my research is to figure out their features, mainly about quality scores.
  At the moment I am working on a project to develop a new fast and accurate method to create CCS reads (circular consensus sequences)."
