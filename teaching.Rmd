-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------
**Statistical Analysis of High-Thoughput Genomic and Transcriptomic Data - STA426** | We will go through the most important statistical concepts employed in today's High-Thoughput analysis methods, implemented as R packages. The student will propose and perform a project at the end of the course | Fall 
**Statistical Modelling - STA121** | | Fall
**Introduction to Bionformatics I - BCH401 ** | In each lecture we give an overview of the main Bioinformatic tools currently used  | Fall
**Topics in Evolutionary Biology - BIO554 ** | | Fall
**Modern Genetics and Genomics - BIO323 ** | Key concepts and methods in genetics will be taught. You will conduct genetic and molecular studies in model systems and analyse data using bioinformatic tools | Fall
**Cancer Epigenetics - BIO255** (Block Course) | The lab gives a two week practical session along with other 5 different labs. The workload is divided in applying molecular biology techniques and a bioinformatic session | Fall
**Practical Bionformatics - BIO334** (Block Course) | The lab gives a two week section of this course. We provide the student with the basics on performing straightforward data manipulations and statistical analyses in R | Spring
**Data Analysis in Biology - BIO144** | This course is organized by the [Petchey lab](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/petchey_owen.html). Our lab provides support in the practical sessions | Spring
